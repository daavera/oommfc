    "# Advanced installation instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not want to use Anaconda, then in order to install `joommf` you will first need a working installation of OOMMF. The installation procedure is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install OOMMF**, using ONE of the following two options:\n",
    "   * Installing OOMMF directly on your computer - instructions are provided subsequently for different operating systems.\n",
    "   * Installing Docker, by following the [installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/install/) (with Docker, JOOMMF will download the OOMMF software automatically).\n",
    "2. **Install JOOMMF**\n",
    "\n",
    "For further instructions, refer to the section for the operating system you use. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Please note that you do not need to install OOMMF directly (step 1 in susequent instructions) if you install Docker instead. In that case, please follow only the instructions for JOOMMF installation (step 2).**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Install OOMMF\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, you need to install `tcl` on your machine. To do this, download the `.exe` file from this [link](http://www.activestate.com/activetcl/downloads), appropriate for your Windows operating system (32-bit or 64-bit). After the download is complete, run the downloaded file and follow the instructions to complete the installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Download the `.zip` file for the latest OOMMF version which is appropriate for your Windows OS (32-bit or 64-bit) from this [link](https://math.nist.gov/oommf/software-20.html). After the download is complete, unzip (extract) it. Locate among the the unzipped files `oommf.tcl` and remember its location. We are going to need it in step 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In order to help JOOMMF find where `oommf.tcl` is, we need to set the value of environment variable `OOMMFTCL`. To do this, in Control Panel, select `System` -> `Advanced system settings` (`tab Advanced`) -> `Environment variables`. In User variables select `New...` and type `OOMMFTCL` for Variable name and `C:\\path\\you\\remembered\\from\\step2\\oommf.tcl` to Variable value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Install JOOMMF\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On Windows, before we install `oommfc`, we need to install `Python3` Anaconda distribution. Therefore, download \"Graphical Installer\" for `Python3` (or \"Command-line installer\" for `Python3` if you are confident with command prompt) from this [link](https://www.anaconda.com/download). After the download is done, run the `.exe` file and follow the instructions to install `Anaconda3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now we have everything required to install `joommf`. Run in Command Prompt:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install joommf\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## MacOS\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Install OOMMF\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To compile OOMMF on MacOS, make sure you have `XCode` (installed from the AppStore) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/mac) installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Clone the repository by typing\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/fangohr/oommf.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "in your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To compile OOMMF, change the directory (`cd oommf`) and run:\n",
    "```\n",
    "make build-with-dmi-extension-all\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command, apart from building OOMMF, will download and compile Dzyaloshinkii-Moriya extensions as well. For more information, please refer to the [OOMMF reporsitory](https://github.com/fangohr/oommf).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Finally, we have to set the environment variable `OOMMFTCL`, so that JOOMMF knows where to find OOMMF. Consequently, in your home directory, add the path to `oommf.tcl` file to the end of the `.bash_profile` file. More specifically, the line at the end of your file should look like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "export OOMMFTCL=\"/path/to/your/compiled/oommf.tcl\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Please note that after editing `.bash_profile` file, you need to refresh your environment variables**\n",
    "```\n",
    "source ~/.bashrc\n",
    "```\n",
    "**or simply reopen the Terminal window.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Install JOOMMF\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On MacOS, before we install JOOMMF, we need to install `Python3` Anaconda distribution. Therefore, download the \"Graphical Installer\" for `Python3` (or \"Command-line installer\" for `Python3` if you feel confident with terminal) from this [link](https://www.anaconda.com/download). After the download is done, run the `.pkg` file and follow the instructions to install `Anaconda3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now we have everything required to install `joommf`. Therefore, run in terminal:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 -m pip install joommf\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linux (Ubuntu)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Install OOMMF\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can compile OOMMF on your machine by firstly installing required packages:\n",
    "```\n",
    "apt-get install git tcl-dev tk-dev\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Clone the repository:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/fangohr/oommf.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To compile OOMMF, change the directory (`cd oommf`) and simply run:\n",
    "```\n",
    "make build-with-dmi-extension-all\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command, apart from building OOMMF, will download and compile Dzyaloshinkii-Moriya extensions as well. For more information, please refer to the [OOMMF reporsitory](https://github.com/fangohr/oommf).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Finally, we have to set the environment variable `OOMMFTCL`, so that previously installed `oommfc` knows where to find OOMMF. Consequently, in your home directory, add the path to `oommf.tcl` file to the end of the `.bashrc` file. More specifically, the line at the emd of your file should look like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "export OOMMFTCL=\"/path/to/your/oommf.tcl\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please note that after editing `.bashrc` file, you need to refresh your environment variables**\n",
    "```\n",
    "source ~/.bashrc\n",
    "```\n",
    "**or simply reopen the Terminal window.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Install JOOMMF\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To install OOMMFC, we first have to make sure you have `pip` installed. **Please note that this command requires root privileges (sudo).**\n",
    "```\n",
    "apt-get install python3-pip\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Now, we can install `oommfc`\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 -m pip install oommfc\n",
    "```"
